	Sweet Farm’s mission is to provide life-long care for our rescued animals, and to educate the public about humane animal care and practices. We rehabilitate mistreated animals and when possible, find appropriate homes for them. In an effort to prevent further cruelty to these animals, we educate the public on caring for farm animals, as well as on issues concerning farmed animals.

	Located on prime farmland in California’s Half Moon Bay, our twelve-acre rescue and rehabilitation sanctuary is home to many unique animal species. Our life-saving animal protection efforts are focused primarily on farm animals and the abuse they suffer, particularly in factory farming situations.

	In addition to our focus on animal welfare, Sweet Farm focuses on teaching the public the impact of factory farming in other areas of our lives, specifically the loss of the diversity and beauty that exists with heritage fruits and vegetables. Through dedicating some of our land to growing these heritage varieties, we hope to share them with our community and bring awareness to their potential loss.

	In 2016, Sweet Farm was established by longtime animal advocates, Anna Sweet &amp; Nathaniel Salpeter. Our sanctuary incorporated as a nonprofit in March 2016, and our 501(c)3 tax-exempt status was confirmed by the IRS in August 2016. Sweet Farm is a 501(c)3 non-profit and our Federal Tax ID No. is 47-4576350.

	Sweet Farm will be regularly open for monthly open houses starting in Spring 2017. Keep an eye on our Facebook page for information on dates and times. The Sweet Farm team, including all of Sweet Farm Animal Ambassadors, look forward to welcoming visitors and volunteers alike to share in the farm experience and joy of being around these wonderful creatures.
