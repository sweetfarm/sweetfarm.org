#### Volunteer

Sweet Farm exists because of it's dedicated supporters and volunteers. We host regular farm work days in which volunteers can help us accomplish much needed tasks around the farm, as well as spend some time with the animals. For safety and liability, all volunteers must be at least 16 years of age. If you are interested in volunteering in any capacity please [contact us directly](/contact/).
