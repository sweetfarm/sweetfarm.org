##### OUR PROGRAMS

Sweet Farm has three core programs that we focus on as an organization - all of which are aimed furthering our core mission of promoting the humane treatment of animals in the food system. In 2017 our focus and funding will be on the following three key programs.

##### FARM ANIMAL RESCUE AND REHABILITATION

During 2017, Sweet Farm will continue it's process of rescuing, rehabilitating, and where appropriate, re-homing farm animals who come from various situations with the food system. These animals will serve as Animal Ambassadors to help spread the message that farm animals are unique, caring creatures who deserve humane treatment and respect. Their faces and stories will help educate the public about the lives and experiences of the many animals they represent.

##### FARM ANIMAL EDUCATION

During 2017, Sweet Farm will continue development of educational materials that inform our local community and the broader public about issues related to farm animal welfare. These educational programs will take many forms, including on-site open houses & events, as well as educational outreach through our website, social media, newsletters and other forms.

##### AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION 

During 2017, Sweet Farm will begin a program of educating our local community and the broader public about the impact of factory farming on the fruits and vegetables we eat, as well as the experience of growing & preserving heritage plants. We believe it's important for people to understand where their food comes from - both plant and animal, in order to make educated decisions about what they choose to eat. In particular, in 2017 we plan to partner with Jay's Sober Living house - a Bay Area organization that helps youth and young adults build new skills and lives while recovering from drug and alcohol addiction. The members of Jay's Sober Living house will have the opportunity to grow skills in agriculture and spend meaningful time in a farm environment.
