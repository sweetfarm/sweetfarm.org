	<h5 id="mama-goat">Mama Goat</h5>

<p>Her actual name is Nibblets, but we call her Mama Goat because she keeps an eye on the entire goat herd. Mama Goat was raised as a dairy goat and milked for a few years until she was retired. She was then sent to a live market. In live markets, animals are selected by customers and killed on-site for their meat. A local family rescued Mama Goat from the market and Sweet Farm took her in as a full-time Animal Ambassador. The other goats love to sleep next her during nap time in the pasture.</p>

<h5 id="hoover">Hoover</h5>

<p>Hoover, a male Boer goat, was raised by a local butcher for sale in their live market. In live markets, animals are selected by customers and killed on-site for their meat. A local family rescued Hoover from the market and Sweet Farm took him in as a full-time Animal Ambassador. He became immediate best friends with Alf and the two spend all day playing in the field and trying to decide who gets to stand on top of the igloo.</p>

<h5 id="alf">Alf</h5>

<p>Alf, a male Boer goat, was raised by a local girl in 4-H as an animal project. Raised by the family from a baby, Alf’s charming personality grew on them. But since they didn’t live on a farm themselves, they couldn’t keep him and provide him with the space and goat friends that he needs.  Sweet Farm brought Alf to the farm as a full-time Animal Ambassador and loves to spend his days romping in his large pasture and playing with his best friend Hoover.</p>
