	<h5 id="stella">Stella</h5>

<p>Stella was living on a local farm. Because of her small size, the farmer didn’t want her anymore because she was too small for wool or meat, and was planning to have her butchered just to get rid of her. The Sweet Farm team had stopped by the farm to purchase an old farm truck and saw Stella. They couldn’t leave her behind and brought her to live at Sweet Farm as an Animal Ambassador. At Sweet Farm, everyone thinks Stella is perfect just the way she is!</p>

<h5 id="ragnar">Ragnar</h5>

<p>Ragnar was born in a local backyard. The family had a small flock of sheep they were breeding for milk, and Ragnar was not needed as a male. A neighboring family contact Sweet Farm and the team went right over to pick him up. Ragnar is an Icelandic sheep, which means his wool gets extra-long and super warm, so he has to be sheared more often than the other sheep. But Ragnar doesn’t mind! He’s just happy to spend his days lounging around the farm with his friends Stella and Hilo.</p>

<h5 id="hilo">Hilo</h5>

<p>Hilo was born on a neighboring farm that didn’t have room for another male sheep. The Sweet Farm team took him in at 4 months old, and he’s become an immediate farm favorite. Hilo was named by one of our dedicated Sweet Farm supporters (Thanks Sandra Lawrence!) and is a hair sheep. Hair sheep are normally raised for their meat, and they coat is made of hair instead of wool. Instead of being sheared, their hair naturally falls out. Hilo will spend his days lounging around Sweet Farm and spending time with his sheep &amp; goat friends.</p>

<p>Your donations go to support the sheep with food, bedding, and regular medical check-ups.</p>
