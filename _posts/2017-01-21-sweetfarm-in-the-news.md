Recently, Sweet Farm received some fantastic news coverage. Our local paper, The Mercury News and the CBS Channel 5 News both featured the farm. We are incredibly honored by the coverage and excited to have our message, and our animals stories reach a larger audience. Sweet Farm exists because of the support and donations of our community and we couldnâ€™t do our lifesaving work without you. 

We have had an amazing first year in 2016 and are looking forward to seeing with 2017 brings! Check out our coverage below:
