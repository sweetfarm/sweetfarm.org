Sweet Farm has dedicated a portion of our land to the growing of heirloom fruits and vegetables. We believe it’s important for people for understand where their food comes from, across both plants and animals. Just like the animals harmed by factory farming, the factory farming of crops has resulted in an decrease in variety and quality of the food we eat, and their loss of some of the most beautiful types of plants.

While it’s currently rainy and cold in Northern California,  this January the Sweet Farm team has begun starting seeds under our barn grow light setup. So far we’ve planted a selection of Sweet Peas and Zinnias, as well as early starts of tomatoes and peppers. We’ll be moving this starts outside in a few months, and they fruits of this labor will be available to Sweet Farm visitors at our open houses this spring.

Keep an eye on our website and Facebook page for upcoming Open House dates!
