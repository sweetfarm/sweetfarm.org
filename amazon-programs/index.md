Sweet Farm is currently running two programs through Amazon which sponsors may elect to contribute to. All proceeds go directly to caring for [the animals on the farm](/residents).

##### Amazon Wishlist

Our Amazon Wisthlist is a list of items we need for the farm that can be purchased on Amazon. By purchasing something off of our wishlist, you're able to directly assist in the caretaking needs of our animals.
