<h5 id="our-mission">Our Mission</h5>

<p>
Sweet Farmâ€™s mission is to provide life-long care for our rescued animals, and to educate the public about humane animal care and practices. We rehabilitate mistreated animals and when possible, find appropriate homes for them. In an effort to prevent further cruelty to these animals, we educate the public on caring for farm animals, as well as on issues concerning farmed animals. Our life-saving animal protection efforts are focused primarily on farm animals and the abuse they suffer, particularly in factory farming situations.

<p>
In addition to our focus on animal welfare, Sweet Farm focuses on teaching the public the impact of factory farming in other areas of our lives, specifically the loss of the diversity and beauty that exists with heritage fruits and vegetables. Through dedicating some of our land to growing these heritage varieties, we hope to share them with our community and bring awareness to their potential loss.
