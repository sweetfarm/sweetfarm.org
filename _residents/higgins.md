When visitors come to Sweet Farm, one of the animals that often greets them is Higgins. Before moving to Half Moon Bay, CA Anna and Nate were active fosters and volunteers at cat and dog rescues in Seattle, WA. One of the key requirements that Anna and Nate had for any foster they took in was that they were considered ‘tough to place’ by the shelters.  This designation often comes from a variety of reasons, whether they are not considered “the most beautiful” in the traditional sense, or are very timid due to past trauma and don’t stand out among a group of shelter dogs as a result.  These dogs can often times go unnoticed in the system for months without finding a forever home. 

By focusing on these animals in the system, Anna and Nate were able to bring numerous dogs into their foster care and socialize them with the other companions in their home, all the while showing the world their amazing personalities through social media dedicated to each individual animal.  In each of their cases, these ‘hard to place’ companions not only quickly found forever homes, they often times had large wait lists of people all wanting to bring these wonderful friends to a loving home. 

It wasn’t until Autumn of 2014 that Anna and Nate met Higgins.  Alone and shaking in the corner of the shelter, Nate immediately pointed him out and asked about him.  Higgins came to Seattle from a high-kill shelter in southern California when he was placed on the short list for euthanasia due to a cough, despite being up to date on his shots.  Higgins immediately took to all members of the family – humans, cats and dogs alike.  Anna & Nate quickly realized that Higgins would stay.

Higgins is a “Chorkie” – a Chihuahua and Yorkie mix, which is what gives him his stylish hair. Higgins makes all visitors to Sweet Farm smile, and is a hard working farm dog despite his small size.
