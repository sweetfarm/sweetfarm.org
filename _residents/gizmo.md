Gizmo, a registered Miniature Hereford Steer, was raised by a local girl in 4-H as an animal project. Raised by the family from a calf, Gizmo’s charming personality grew on them. Instead of sending him to be auctioned for slaughter, his family reached out to Sweet Farm to provide him a loving home.  Sweet Farm and its wonderful community of followers joined together in helping to pay off the family’s 4-H loan taken out to raise Gizmo.

He has since been brought to the farm as a full time Animal Ambassador and loves to spend his days romping in his large pasture. He’s currently working on his running skills, in an attempt to keep up with his best friend Sturgis – our resident elderly Stallion.

Your donations go to support Gizmo with food, bedding, and regular medical check-ups.
