Sturgis came to us from a local woman whoâ€™s pasture had flooded. Because he was a stallion he had to be kept separate from the mares and she had no other place to put him. At the senior age of 31, he was stuck in mud and she feared her only option would be to put him down. Sweet Farm took him and he can now regularly be seen running in the pastures, enjoying the open space and green grass.

Sturgis has become the best friend of Gizmo the cow, and you can almost always find the two hanging out, playing together or bathing each other.

Your donations go to his food, bedding, senior medical care and plenty of carrots & apples as treats!
