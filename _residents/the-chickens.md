The Sweet Farm Chicken Crew is a beautiful assortment of birds. Many of our chickens are rescued from the local humane society where they were dropped off after no longer being needed or wanted in backyards and on other farms. Seeing their diversity in both colors and personalities makes the chicken yard a relaxing and enjoyable space. On any given day, youâ€™ll find the chicken crew hard at work eating bugs, taking dirt baths and laying healthy, nutrient rich eggs. 

Each member of the Chicken Crew has a name, and the team at Sweet Farm makes sure they have plenty of space to run & play.  Their get plenty of organic food with dietary supplements and treats to keep them healthy and ensure they feel loved. They even have three separate playground structures to keep them entertained!

Your donations keep the chickens fed, provide clean bedding and cover medical care when needed.
