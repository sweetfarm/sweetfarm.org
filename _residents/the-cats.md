##### Jackie

Jackie was found living in the old barn on at Sweet Farm. She was very old and frail, and very thin from having to catch her all her own meals. We took her to the vet, gave her plenty of food & pets, and now this elderly lady can be found lounging in sunny spots around the farm. She still occasionally chases down mice around the barn, but only when she’s not busy napping.

##### Gretchen
Gretchen came to Sweet Farm from a local cat rescue. She was homeless and living in a local neighborhood where raccoons were often seen chasing her. The Sweet Farm team brought her to the farm where she is happy to oversee any chores being done around the farm. She’s our top farm manager!

##### Farfield

Farfield appeared at Sweet Farm earlier this year. The Sweet Farm team were able to trap him, fix him & get him his shots. Since then he’s become of the friendliest cats on the farm. He’s most commonly found lounging on the porch, but don’t let that fool you – Farfield is a pro when it comes to keeping gophers out of the pastures.

##### Elsie & Charlotte

Elsie and Charlotte were relocated to our property with the help of a local feral cat rescue. These two lovely, feral tabby girls won’t let you pet them, but they love sleeping in the warm hay at night and taking care of rodents during the day. These two lovely ladies are some of the hardest working volunteers on the farm. 

Your donations go to support cats with food and bedding.
